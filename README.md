# minecraft-hello_world_data_pack
A Minecraft (bedrock) data-pack that adds blocks that say hello world on them to the game.

## How to add them to your game?
### Preperation (if one has already opened their com.mojang folder, they should skip this)
First, open files. Next, go to the view section. In the view section there should be a settings bar at the top of your file window. That bar should contain a box labeled as "Options." Click that box. After that, if one clicks the label instead of the other part of the box, ther should be a pop down that say "Change folder and search options." If that pop down does not show, a new window that contains various options should shop. If the pop down shows instead, clicking it will bring someone to the same options window. In that window, click the view section. In the view section there should be two bullit point lists, each with two points. One of those bullit point lists should say something about hidding and showing hidden folders. Click show hidden folders. Click the "Apply" button, then click the "Ok" button. Next, search for:

```%localappdata%\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang```

(one should not search with the small quick access search bar, rather one should search with the large bar).

### Adding the files
After finishing the preperation (if not already done, else skip to the next sentance), download and unzip this repository. Open development_behavior_packs. In a different file window, open the download. Move the hello_world_behavior_pack folder into the development_behavior_packs folder. Back out of the development_behavior_packs folder in the com.mojang file, and open the development_resource_packs folder. Drag the downloaded hello_world_resource_pack folder into the development_resource_packs folder.

### Adding them to a Minecraft world.
After finishing preperation and adding the files, opne Minecraft. Create a new world (old worlds do not accept new packs). Activate the Hello World Behavior Pack in the Behavior Packs section of the Create World minu. The resource pack should automatically be added. Turn on Holiday Creator Features in the Experiments section of the Create World minu. Change the rest of the settings, or don't change them at all, as long as these directions are followed, it should work in the game.
